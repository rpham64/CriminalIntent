# CriminalIntent

**CriminalIntent** is a native Android application used to record details for "office crimes", ie. things such as co-workers not
cleaning up their lunch mess in the lounge, someone not replacing the toilet paper in the bathroom, leaving a coffee stain on the floor,
etc. It's a simple app that I developed for learning the basics of Android.
